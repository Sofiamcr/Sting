Sting 

The app that helps you achieve your goals

www.stingfit.live

Target:
People who have goals and want to change their habits and start working out.

Pain:
Staying committed to the goal you set for yourself

Solution:
You start by setting a goal and choosing an amount of money you’re willing to lose if you don’t make it. Sting connects to your Strava account and checks that you actually worked out. If you don't, you lose money. 
You can also create group challenges with your friends. The money you lose is redistributed to your friends. You can also play cards to increase or decrease other player's weekly goals.
